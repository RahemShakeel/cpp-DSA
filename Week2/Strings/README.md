# Strings in C++

This folder contains examples and code snippets for working with **C++ Strings** (`std::string` from the STL).  
Strings in C++ are more powerful than character arrays because they come with built-in functions for easier manipulation.

---

### Topics Covered
- String Input using `getline`
- For-each loop traversal
- String member functions (`length`, `at`, `substr`, `find`)
- Valid Anagram check

---

### Files and Explanations

- **string_input.cpp** → Input using `getline` and accessing characters.  
- **foreach_loop.cpp** → Traversing strings using for-each loop.  
- **member_functions.cpp** → Demonstrates important `std::string` functions.  
- **anagram.cpp** → Check if two strings are valid anagrams.

These examples will help you understand how to use `std::string` efficiently in C++.
