# Week 2 – Arrays, Sorting, 2D Arrays, Char Arrays & Strings

This week, we moved from the basics of programming into **data structures** and **string handling**.  
The focus was on **arrays, sorting algorithms, 2D arrays, and string manipulation**.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Arrays
- Introduction to **1D arrays**.
- Traversal and storage.
- Use of arrays for storing sequential data.

**Files**: Inside the `Arrays/` folder.

---

### 2. Basic Sorting Algorithms
- Implemented fundamental sorting techniques:
  - **Bubble Sort** → Compare adjacent elements and swap if out of order.
  - **Selection Sort** → Find the minimum element and place it at the correct position.
  - **Insertion Sort** → Build the sorted array one element at a time.
  - **Counting Sort** → Works efficiently for integers in a known range.
  - **Inbuilt Sort** → Using `std::sort` from the C++ STL.

**Files**: Inside the `Sorting/` folder.

### 3. 2D Arrays
- Understanding **matrix representation**.
- Introduction to **dynamic allocation of 2D arrays** using `new`.
- Accessing elements through pointers and indices.

**Files**: Inside the `2DArrays/` folder.

---

### 4. Char Arrays and Strings
- **Char Arrays**:
  - Basics of null-terminated strings (`\0`).
  - Input/output with `cin` and `cout`.
  - Common pitfalls in handling C-style strings.

- **Strings (STL)**:
  - Using `std::string` for easier string manipulation.
  - Common functions like `.length()`, `.substr()`, `.find()`, and concatenation.

**Files**: Inside the `CharArray/` and `Strings/` folders.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of Week 2, we learned:
- How to declare, initialize, and traverse **arrays and 2D arrays**.
- Different sorting techniques and when to use them.
- The difference between **char arrays (C-style strings)** and **C++ STL strings**.
- How dynamic allocation works with multi-dimensional arrays.
