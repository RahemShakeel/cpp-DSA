# Vectors in C++

In this module, we explore **Vectors**, one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in C++. Unlike arrays, vectors are **dynamic** - they can resize themselves as elements are added or removed.

---

## Topics Covered
1. **Vectors Basics** – Declaring and initializing vectors  
2. **Vector Functions** – Using `push_back`, `pop_back`, `size`, and `capacity`  
3. **Vector Memory Management** – Difference between size and capacity  
4. **2D Vectors** – Representing matrices using nested vectors

## Key Learnings
- **Dynamic resizing** makes vectors safer and more flexible than arrays.  
- `size()` → Number of elements stored.  
- `capacity()` → Allocated memory (often grows in powers of 2).  
- `push_back()` → Adds element at the end, resizing if needed.  
- `pop_back()` → Removes last element.  
- **2D Vectors** allow matrix-like data handling without manual memory management.
