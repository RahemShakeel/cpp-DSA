# Getters and Setters in C++

This section demonstrates how **Getters** and **Setters** are used in Object-Oriented Programming to control access to private class members.

## 1. Student Class Example
- **Private Members:** `name`, `cgpa`
- **Setters:** Assign values to private data.
- **Getters:** Retrieve values.
- **Utility Function:** `getPercentage()` converts CGPA into percentage.

## 2. Practice Question: User Class
- **Private Members:** `id`, `password`
- **Public Member:** `username`
- **Parameterized Constructor:** Initializes `id`
- **Getter and Setter:** Used for `password`

## Key Takeaway
- Getters and Setters are crucial for **Encapsulation** in OOP.
- They help hide internal data and provide controlled access.
