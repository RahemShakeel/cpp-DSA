# DSA with C++ — Code Snippets and Weekly Progress

Welcome to my C++ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning repository!

This repo contains **clean, beginner-friendly code snippets** that I’ve written while practicing. It is structured **week-by-week** to match my learning progress and help others learn alongside me.

## Content?

Each week covers a set of topics, and only practical topics include code. The code is organized into folders such as:
All code is written in **C++** and includes **comments for better understanding**

## Why This Repo?

I created this repo to:

- Practice and revise DSA concepts  
- Share well-commented code that can help other beginners  
- Stay consistent with my weekly learning  
- Build a strong foundation in problem-solving using C++
